                <p>I'm very passionate about coding, but I also enjoy to go to the gym and play disc golf too.</p>

                <p>I'm constantly improving myself in the technology field, and I spend lots of hours sitting at the
                    computer and learn those things. I'm a strong team player and I like to have people around me, who
                    support my goals, and also I'm willing to help people back as much as I can!</p>

                <p>After I graduate, my next five-year plan is to be able to buy a house and also be able to travel
                    more.</p>

                <h4>Side</h4>
                <p>Frontend is my side part of web developing field. I'm not the best one for design layouts, colors,
                    or images for websites, but I'm still enough good to be able to handle this kind of relatively easy
                    websites if needed.</p>

                <h4>Main</h4>
                <p>Backend is my main developing field. I enjoy solving problems with connections and I'm curious to
                    understand everything which happens kinda "under the hood". I cannot say that I'm extremely good at
                    it (YET), but I definitely will be!</p>

                <h4>Future</h4>
                <p>My goal is to be a Fullstack developer. I prefer lot more Backend developing, but I still want to
                    learn Frontend developing too, and also to be able to handle its latest technigues.</p>
